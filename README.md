# scroll-lock-functionality
A program which adds functionality to the scroll lock key.

## Info
This program is currently in the beta phase but I'm working on it to make it available to you as soon as possible :) 

## Building it on your own
If you want to build this app for your system, you can clone this repo, then run the following command:

```
npm run make
```

After some time you should see a directory called "out". You can find the application in it.
